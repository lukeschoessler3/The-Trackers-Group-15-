- For Milestone 4, we implemented the functionality to add a meal and remove a meal.
- We made a meal class that has the name, ingredients, and total calories as fields. Then, we made the add_meal function which takes a list "meals" as a parameter. An instance of the meal object is made with the user's input and is added to the "meals" list. Lastly, we made a delete_meal function where the user inputs the name of the meal to be deleted, and the code goes through the "meals" list until it finds the meal and removes it.
- We implemented this with pair programming. For the different parts, someone was writing the code, and someone else was reviewing and giving suggestions.
- This functionality relates to the overall system design because it is part of the controller aspect of the MVC design. This part of the code will add and delete meals that, in the future, the user will input. In the future, this portion will connect the view into actions for the model. This code just controls the creating and deleting of meals with no frontend view at the moment, but could potentially be implemented in the future.
